      <p>
        It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at
        occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind
        which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies),
        rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of
        the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
